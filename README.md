# railworks_scenario_lua
Some LUA scripts by me for railworks. Feel free to use it in your scenarios. Do mention me if you publish it anywhere.

Only people who know about lua scripting(checkout videos on YT) will be able to understand and use the script.
To install, add the files in the Scenario directory of which you are working on.
